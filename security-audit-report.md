# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted on April 17, 2025 for the AI Amazona e-commerce application. The audit found several security issues that should be addressed to improve the overall security posture of the application.

**Critical Issues:**
- Exposed sensitive API keys in environment files
- Insufficient password hashing configuration
- Missing CSRF protection for critical operations
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints

**Summary of Findings:**
- 3 Critical Issues
- 5 High-Risk Issues
- 7 Medium-Risk Issues
- 4 Low-Risk Issues

## Methodology

The audit was conducted using a combination of:
- Automated security scanning using the `security-audit.js` script
- Manual code review
- Dependency vulnerability analysis
- Configuration review
- Environment variable review

## Detailed Findings

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Critical: Insufficient Password Hashing Configuration
- **Description**: The application uses bcrypt for password hashing but doesn't explicitly set the number of salt rounds.
- **Impact**: This could result in weaker-than-expected password hashing if the default value is too low.
- **Recommendation**: Explicitly set salt rounds to at least 12 in all password hashing functions.
- **Location**: `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`, `lib/user.ts`

#### High: Missing Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints
- **Description**: The authentication endpoints do not implement rate limiting, allowing unlimited login attempts.
- **Impact**: Susceptible to brute force attacks against user passwords.
- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting on all authentication endpoints using a package like `express-rate-limit`.
- **Location**: `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`

#### Medium: JWT Configuration Issues
- **Description**: JWT tokens have a long expiration time and use a weak secret.
- **Impact**: Long-lived sessions increase the risk if a JWT token is compromised.
- **Recommendation**: Reduce JWT expiration time to 1 hour and use a strong, randomly generated secret.
- **Location**: `auth.config.ts`

#### Medium: Role-Based Access Control Inconsistencies
- **Description**: Some admin routes don't consistently check for admin role.
- **Impact**: Potential unauthorized access to admin features.
- **Recommendation**: Implement consistent role checking in all admin routes and middleware.
- **Location**: Various admin API routes in `app/api/admin/`

### API Security

#### Critical: Missing CSRF Protection
- **Description**: The application does not implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations.
- **Impact**: Susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks, allowing attackers to perform actions as authenticated users.
- **Recommendation**: Implement CSRF protection using the `csrf` library or Next.js built-in CSRF protection.
- **Location**: All API routes in `app/api/`

#### High: Incomplete Input Validation
- **Description**: Some API endpoints lack proper input validation or sanitization.
- **Impact**: Potential for injection attacks or unexpected behavior with malformed input.
- **Recommendation**: Use Zod schemas consistently for all API inputs and implement sanitization for user-generated content.
- **Location**: Multiple endpoints, especially in `app/api/orders/` and `app/api/products/`

#### High: Overly Detailed Error Messages
- **Description**: Some API endpoints return detailed error messages in production.
- **Impact**: Information leakage that could help attackers understand the system's internals.
- **Recommendation**: Implement error handling middleware that sanitizes error messages in production.
- **Location**: Multiple API endpoints

#### Medium: Missing Security Headers
- **Description**: Several important security headers are not set in the application.
- **Impact**: Increased vulnerability to XSS, clickjacking, and other browser-based attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Add all recommended security headers in middleware.ts.
- **Location**: `middleware.ts`

### Data Security

#### Critical: Sensitive API Keys Exposed
- **Description**: Several sensitive API keys are stored in the `.env` file without proper masking.
- **Impact**: If the `.env` file is accidentally committed or exposed, these keys could be compromised.
- **Recommendation**: Use environment variable management services and ensure all sensitive values are masked.
- **Location**: `.env`

#### High: Insufficient Data Sanitization
- **Description**: User-generated content is not consistently sanitized before storage or display.
- **Impact**: Potential for stored XSS attacks if malicious content is saved and then displayed to users.
- **Recommendation**: Use sanitize-html consistently for all user-generated content.
- **Location**: `app/api/reviews/route.ts`, `app/api/users/profile/route.ts`

#### High: SQL Injection Risks in Custom Queries
- **Description**: While most database access uses Prisma ORM, there are a few places with custom SQL queries.
- **Impact**: Potential for SQL injection in these custom queries.
- **Recommendation**: Either use Prisma for all database access or ensure proper parameterization.
- **Location**: `server/reports.js`

#### Medium: Unencrypted Sensitive Data
- **Description**: Some sensitive user data is stored unencrypted in the database.
- **Impact**: If the database is compromised, this data would be exposed in plain text.
- **Recommendation**: Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data like addresses and phone numbers.
- **Location**: Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`

### Infrastructure & Configuration

#### Medium: Outdated Dependencies
- **Description**: Several dependencies are not on their latest versions.
- **Impact**: Missing security patches could introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Recommendation**: Update all dependencies to their latest versions and implement a regular update schedule.
- **Location**: `package.json`

#### Low: Missing Content Security Policy
- **Description**: The application does not implement a Content Security Policy.
- **Impact**: Increased risk of XSS and other content injection attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Implement a strict Content Security Policy in middleware.ts.
- **Location**: `middleware.ts`

#### Low: Insecure Cookie Configuration
- **Description**: Some cookies are not set with secure and httpOnly flags.
- **Impact**: Cookies could be accessed by client-side scripts or transmitted over insecure connections.
- **Recommendation**: Set all cookies with secure and httpOnly flags.
- **Location**: `auth.config.ts`

#### Low: Development Configurations in Production
- **Description**: Some development-specific configurations are present in production.
- **Impact**: Potential for information leakage or unnecessary functionality in production.
- **Recommendation**: Use environment-specific configuration files and ensure strict separation.
- **Location**: `next.config.ts`

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions (0-7 days)
1. Fix critical issues:
   - Update password hashing configuration

1. Address high-risk issues:
   - Implement consistent input validation
   - Fix error message handling
   - Improve data sanitization
   - Fix SQL injection risks

2. Update all outdated dependencies

### Medium-term Actions (1-3 months)
1. Address all medium-risk issues:
   - Implement field-level encryption
   - Fix JWT configuration
   - Ensure consistent role-based access controls

2. Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Long-term Actions (3+ months)
1. Address all low-risk issues
2. Conduct regular security audits
3. Implement security monitoring and alerting
4. Conduct a penetration test

## Conclusion

The AI Amazona e-commerce application has several security issues that should be addressed according to the remediation plan. While some critical issues require immediate attention, the overall security architecture is sound and follows many security best practices.

Once the identified issues are addressed, the application will have a strong security posture in line with industry standards for e-commerce applications.
